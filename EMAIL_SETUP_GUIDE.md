## üöÄ Next Steps to Complete Setup

### Step 1: Verify Your Domain in Resend

1. Log in to [Resend Dashboard](https://resend.com/dashboard)
2. Go to **Domains** section
3. Add your domain: `shennastudio.com`
4. Follow the DNS verification instructions:
   - Add the provided DNS records to your domain registrar
   - Wait for verification (usually a few minutes)

**Note**: Until domain is verified, you can test using Resend's development mode, but emails will only go to the registered account email.

### Step 2: Update Admin Email

Change the `ADMIN_EMAIL` in `frontend/.env.local` to your actual email address:

```bash
ADMIN_EMAIL=your-actual-email@example.com
```

### Step 3: Set Up Stripe Webhook

#### For Local Development (Testing):

1. Install Stripe CLI:
   ```bash
   brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe
   ```

2. Login to Stripe:
   ```bash
   stripe login
   ```

3. Forward webhooks to your local server:
   ```bash
   stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe
   ```

4. Copy the webhook signing secret (starts with `whsec_`) and add to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...your_secret...
   ```

#### For Production:

1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)
2. Click **Add endpoint**
3. Enter your webhook URL:
   ```
   https://www.shennastudio.com/api/webhooks/stripe
   ```
4. Select events to listen for:
   - `checkout.session.completed`
5. Copy the **Signing secret** and add it to your production environment variables in Railway

### Step 4: Add Stripe Keys

Add your Stripe API keys to `frontend/.env.local`:

```bash
# Stripe Configuration
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...your_test_key...
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...your_test_key...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...your_webhook_secret...
```

**For production**, add the live keys:
```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
```

### Test with Stripe CLI (Local):

```bash
# Trigger a test webhook event

```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Sending:

1. **Check Resend API Key**:
   - Verify `RESEND_API_KEY` in `.env.local` is correct
   - Check Resend dashboard for API key status

2. **Check Console Logs**:

   - Check for Resend-specific errors
