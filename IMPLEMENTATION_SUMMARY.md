# Implementation Summary - Address Capture, Blog System, and SEO

## üéâ COMPLETED TASKS

### 1. Order Address Capture ‚úÖ

**Problem**: Orders weren't capturing shipping and billing addresses from Stripe checkout.

**Solution Implemented**:

1. **Updated Prisma Schema** (`frontend/prisma/schema.prisma`):
   - Added comprehensive address fields to Order model:
     - Customer information (email, name, phone)
     - Shipping address (all fields)
     - Billing address (all fields)
     - Stripe session tracking
   - Added indexes for performance

2. **Enhanced Stripe Webhook** (`frontend/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`):
   - Now saves complete order data to database
   - Captures both shipping and billing addresses
   - Stores order items with pricing
   - Maintains email functionality
   - Added proper error handling

**REQUIRED NEXT STEPS**:

```bash
# Run this command to apply the database schema changes
cd frontend
npx prisma migrate dev --name add-order-addresses
npx prisma generate
```

### 2. Blog Image Upload System ‚úÖ

**Problem**: Blog admin only had URL input for images, no actual upload functionality.

**Solution Implemented**:

1. **Created ImageUpload Component** (`frontend/app/components/ImageUpload.tsx`):
   - Drag-and-drop file upload
   - Image preview
   - File size validation (max 5MB)
   - Image type validation
   - Loading states

2. **Created Upload API** (`frontend/app/api/upload-image/route.ts`):
   - Cloudinary integration
   - Automatic image optimization
   - Proper folder organization (shenna-studio/blog)
   - Error handling

3. **Updated Blog Admin Pages**:
   - `frontend/app/admin/blog/new/page.tsx` - New posts with image upload
   - `frontend/app/admin/blog/[id]/page.tsx` - Edit posts with image upload

**REQUIRED CONFIGURATION**:

Ensure these environment variables are set in `frontend/.env`:
```env
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
```

### 3. SEO Improvements (Partial) ‚úÖ

**Completed**:
- ‚úÖ Breadcrumbs component exists and has schema markup
- ‚úÖ Added Breadcrumbs to Products page

**STILL NEEDED** (see "To-Do" section below):
- Add Breadcrumbs to other pages
- Enhance product schema markup
- Add meta descriptions where missing

---

## üìã TO-DO LIST

### Priority 1: Database Migration (CRITICAL)

```bash
cd frontend
npx prisma migrate dev --name add-order-addresses
npx prisma generate
```

This MUST be run before the webhook can save orders!

### Priority 2: Admin Orders Page

Create `frontend/app/admin/orders/page.tsx` to view orders with addresses:

```tsx
'use client'

import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'

export default function AdminOrdersPage() {
  const [orders, setOrders] = useState([])

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchOrders()
  }, [])

  const fetchOrders = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('/api/admin/orders')
    const data = await response.json()
    setOrders(data.orders)
  }

  return (
    <div className="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 py-8">
      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-8">Orders</h1>
      {/* Display orders with shipping/billing addresses */}
    </div>
  )
}
```

Create API route: `frontend/app/api/admin/orders/route.ts`

### Priority 3: Complete SEO Implementation

Add Breadcrumbs to these pages:
- [ ] `frontend/app/about/page.tsx`
- [ ] `frontend/app/contact/page.tsx`
- [ ] `frontend/app/faq/page.tsx`
- [ ] `frontend/app/shipping/page.tsx`
- [ ] `frontend/app/returns/page.tsx`
- [ ] `frontend/app/products/[handle]/page.tsx`
- [ ] `frontend/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`

Add/verify meta descriptions on all pages as specified in `SEO_IMPROVEMENTS.md`.

### Priority 4: Test Stripe Webhook

1. Install Stripe CLI:
   ```bash
   brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe
   ```

2. Forward webhooks to local:
   ```bash
   stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe
   ```

3. Copy the webhook signing secret to `.env`:
   ```env
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
   ```

4. Test a complete checkout flow
5. Verify order is saved to database with addresses

### Priority 5: Production Webhook Setup

1. Go to Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks
2. Add endpoint: `https://www.shennastudio.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
3. Select events: `checkout.session.completed`
4. Copy webhook signing secret to production environment variables
