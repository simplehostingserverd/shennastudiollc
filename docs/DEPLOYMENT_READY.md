# 🚀 Deployment Ready - Changes Summary

## ✅ What's Been Fixed

### 1. Order Address Capture (CRITICAL FIX)
- **Problem**: Customers' shipping/billing addresses weren't being saved
- **Solution**: Updated Order schema and Stripe webhook to capture ALL address data
- **Status**: ✅ Code Complete - **Requires Migration** (see below)

### 2. Blog System with Image Upload
- **Problem**: Blog admin couldn't upload images (only URL input)
- **Solution**: Added Cloudinary integration with drag-and-drop upload
- **Status**: ✅ Complete and Working

### 3. Blog Authentication
- **Problem**: Need admin-only access to blog management
- **Solution**: Login system already exists, added protection to blog routes
- **Status**: ✅ Complete and Working

## 🔧 What You Need To Do Before Deploying

### 1. Run Database Migration (CRITICAL!)

```bash
cd frontend
npx prisma migrate dev --name add-order-addresses
npx prisma generate
```

**Or use the manual SQL** in `MIGRATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md` if automatic migration fails.

### 2. Set Environment Variables

Ensure these are in your `.env`:

```env
# Database (Required for orders and blog)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:5432/database

# Cloudinary (Required for blog image uploads)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret

# Stripe Webhook (Required for order capture)
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret

# Admin Auth (Required for blog admin)
JWT_SECRET=your-secure-random-string-min-32-chars
```

### 3. Set Up Stripe Webhook (Production)

1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
2. Add endpoint: `https://www.shennastudio.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
3. Select event: `checkout.session.completed`
4. Copy the webhook secret to your environment variables

## 🎯 How To Test Everything

### Test Blog Image Upload:

1. Login at `/admin/login`
2. Go to `/admin/blog/new`
3. Try uploading an image
4. Should upload to Cloudinary and show preview

### Test Order Address Capture:

1. Place a test order through Stripe checkout
2. Fill in shipping address
3. Complete payment
4. Check database: `SELECT * FROM "Order" WHERE "stripeSessionId" LIKE '%_test_%';`
5. Should see all address fields populated

### Test Blog Authentication:

1. Try to access `/admin/blog` without logging in
2. Should redirect to `/admin/login`
3. Login with admin credentials
4. Should see blog management

## 📊 Database Schema Changes

### Before (Order Model):
```prisma
model Order {
  id        String   @id
  userId    String
  total     Int
  status    String
  createdAt DateTime
  updatedAt DateTime
}
```

### After (Order Model):
```prisma
model Order {
  id                  String   @id
  userId              String?  // Made optional
  total               Int
  status              String

  // NEW: Stripe tracking
  stripeSessionId     String?  @unique
  stripePaymentIntent String?

  // NEW: Customer info
  customerEmail       String?
  customerName        String?
  customerPhone       String?

  // NEW: Shipping address (7 fields)
  shippingName        String?
  shippingLine1       String?
  shippingLine2       String?
  shippingCity        String?
  shippingState       String?
  shippingPostalCode  String?
  shippingCountry     String?

  // NEW: Billing address (7 fields)
  billingName         String?
  billingLine1        String?
  billingLine2        String?
  billingCity         String?
  billingState        String?
  billingPostalCode   String?
  billingCountry      String?

  createdAt           DateTime
  updatedAt           DateTime
}
```

## 🔍 What Happens After Deployment

### Immediate Effects:
1. ✅ New orders will have addresses saved
2. ✅ Blog admin can upload images directly
3. ✅ Blog routes require authentication
4. ✅ Breadcrumbs show on Products page

### You'll Be Able To:
- See customer shipping addresses in database
- Ship products to correct addresses
- Manage blog posts with images
- Control who can access blog admin

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Old orders won't have addresses** - Only new orders after migration
2. **Admin account must exist** - Create one if you haven't:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO "User" (id, email, name, password, role)
   VALUES ('admin-id', 'admin@shennastudio.com', 'Admin', 'hashed_password', 'admin');
   ```
3. **Cloudinary is required for blog** - Image upload won't work without it
4. **Stripe webhook must be configured** - Orders won't save without it

## 📚 Documentation Created

## 🐛 If Something Goes Wrong

### Orders not saving addresses:
- Check `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set correctly
- Verify webhook is hitting your production URL
- Check webhook logs in Stripe Dashboard

### Blog images not uploading:
- Verify all 3 Cloudinary env vars are set
- Check Cloudinary dashboard for errors
- Try the test endpoint: `/api/upload-image`

### Can't access blog admin:
- Verify admin user exists in database
- Check `JWT_SECRET` is set (min 32 chars)
- Try clearing cookies and logging in again
