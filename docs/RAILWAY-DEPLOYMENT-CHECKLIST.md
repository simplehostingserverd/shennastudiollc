# Railway Deployment Checklist for Shenna's Studio Backend

## üéØ Quick Fix Summary

Two critical issues were preventing your Railway deployment:

1. ‚ùå **Root Directory not configured** ‚Üí Railway was building from wrong location
2. ‚ùå **Invalid railway.json syntax** ‚Üí JSON parsing error

Both issues are now **FIXED** in the codebase. Follow the steps below to complete deployment.

## ‚úÖ Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Code Fixes (Already Completed ‚úÖ)

- [x] Fixed `databaseExtraOptions` ‚Üí `databaseDriverOptions` in medusa-config.ts
- [x] Merged duplicate `databaseDriverOptions` properties
- [x] Fixed `railway.json` syntax error (removed invalid `environments` section)
- [x] Backend builds successfully locally (`npm run build` passes)
- [x] All changes pushed to GitHub main branch

### Railway Dashboard Configuration (YOU MUST DO THIS)

- [ ] **Set Root Directory to `ocean-backend`** in Service Settings
- [ ] Verify DATABASE_URL is set (from PostgreSQL addon)
- [ ] Verify REDIS_URL is set (from Redis addon)
- [ ] Set JWT_SECRET (min 32 characters, generate with: `openssl rand -base64 32`)
- [ ] Set COOKIE_SECRET (min 32 characters, generate with: `openssl rand -base64 32`)
- [ ] Set NODE_ENV=production
- [ ] Set ADMIN_EMAIL (your admin email)
- [ ] Set ADMIN_PASSWORD (min 8 characters, secure password)
- [ ] Set STORE_CORS (optional: `https://shennastudio.com,https://www.shennastudio.com`)
- [ ] Set ADMIN_CORS (optional: `https://api.shennastudio.com`)
- [ ] Configure custom domain: `api.shennastudio.com` (if applicable)
- [ ] Trigger manual redeploy after configuration

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Deployment Guide

### Step 1: Configure Root Directory (CRITICAL)

1. **Open Railway Dashboard**: https://railway.app/
2. **Select your Backend Service** (the one showing errors)
3. **Click "Settings"** tab
4. **Find "Service Settings" or "Source"** section
5. **Set "Root Directory"**: 
   ```
   ocean-backend
   ```
6. **Save changes**

> **Why this is critical:** Railway needs to know your backend code is in the `ocean-backend/` subdirectory, not the repository root. Without this, Railway can't find `package.json` or run build commands in the correct location.

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables

Click the **"Variables"** tab in your backend service and add:

#### Required Variables

```bash
# Database (auto-populated by PostgreSQL addon)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...

# Redis (auto-populated by Redis addon)
REDIS_URL=redis://...

# Security Secrets (GENERATE NEW ONES!)
JWT_SECRET=<your-32-char-secret>
COOKIE_SECRET=<your-32-char-secret>

# Environment
NODE_ENV=production

# Admin User
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@shennastudio.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=<your-secure-password>
```

#### Generate Secrets

Run these commands locally to generate secure secrets:

```bash
# Generate JWT_SECRET
openssl rand -base64 32

# Generate COOKIE_SECRET
openssl rand -base64 32
```

Copy the output and paste into Railway Variables.

#### Optional Variables (Recommended)

```bash
# CORS Configuration
STORE_CORS=https://shennastudio.com,https://www.shennastudio.com
ADMIN_CORS=https://api.shennastudio.com
AUTH_CORS=https://shennastudio.com,https://www.shennastudio.com,https://api.shennastudio.com

# Database Settings
DATABASE_LOGGING=false
DATABASE_SSL=true
DATABASE_SSL_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=false

# Worker Mode
WORKER_MODE=shared
```

### Step 3: Verify Build Configuration

Your service should have these settings (check Settings tab):

- **Builder**: NIXPACKS (auto-detected)
- **Build Command**: `npm ci && npm run build` (from railway.json)
- **Start Command**: `npm start` (from railway.json)
- **Port**: 9000 (auto-detected from code)

### Step 4: Deploy

1. **Trigger Deploy**:
   - Option A: Click **"Deploy"** ‚Üí **"Redeploy"** in Railway dashboard
   - Option B: Push a new commit to GitHub (auto-deploys if connected)

2. **Watch Build Logs**:
   - Click on the deployment
   - Watch the "Build" tab
   - You should see:
     ```
     ‚úÖ Backend build completed successfully (X.XXs)
     ‚úÖ Frontend build completed successfully (X.XXs)
     ```

3. **Watch Deploy Logs**:
   - Click the "Deploy" tab
   - You should see:
     ```
     üöÇ Starting Shenna's Studio on Railway...
     ‚úÖ Backend build found: .medusa
     üöÄ Starting Medusa backend on port 9000...
     Server is ready on port: 9000
     ```

### Step 5: Verify Deployment

#### Test Health Endpoint

```bash
curl https://<your-railway-domain>/health
# or
curl https://api.shennastudio.com/health
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{"status":"ok"}
```

#### Test Admin Panel

1. Open: `https://<your-railway-domain>/app` or `https://api.shennastudio.com/app`
2. Login with your ADMIN_EMAIL and ADMIN_PASSWORD
3. You should see the Medusa admin dashboard

#### Test API

```bash
curl https://<your-railway-domain>/store/products
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{"products":[],"count":0,"offset":0,"limit":15}
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Backend build not found"

**Symptoms:**
```
‚ùå Backend build not found! Check Railway build logs.
Expected: ocean-backend/.medusa
```

**Fix:**
- Root Directory is NOT set to `ocean-backend`
- Go to Settings ‚Üí Set Root Directory to `ocean-backend`
- Redeploy

### Issue: "failed to parse railway.json"

**Symptoms:**
```
failed to parse ocean-backend/railway.json: failed to decode json file
```

**Fix:**
- This is now fixed in the codebase (commit 999a6be)
- Pull latest changes: `git pull origin main`
- Redeploy

### Issue: Build succeeds but crashes on start

**Symptoms:**
```
Error: Missing required environment variables
```

**Fix:**
- Check that all required env vars are set (DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL, JWT_SECRET, COOKIE_SECRET)
- Go to Variables tab and verify each one
- Redeploy after adding missing variables

### Issue: Database connection errors

**Symptoms:**
```
Error: Connection terminated unexpectedly
```

**Fix:**
- Verify DATABASE_URL is set correctly
- Ensure PostgreSQL addon is attached to the service
- Check that DATABASE_SSL=true is set
- Verify medusa-config.ts has SSL configuration (already in code)

### Issue: Redis connection errors

**Symptoms:**
```
Error: connect ECONNREFUSED (Redis)
```

**Fix:**
- Verify REDIS_URL is set correctly
- Ensure Redis addon is attached to the service
- Redis is required for Medusa v2 in production
