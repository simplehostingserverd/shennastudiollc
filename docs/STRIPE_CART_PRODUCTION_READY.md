# Stripe Cart & Checkout - Production Ready Guide

## üéØ Current Status

I've analyzed and fixed the Stripe cart/checkout system for Shenna's Studio. Here's what has been done and what needs to happen next.

---

## ‚úÖ What I Fixed

### 1. Backend Configuration ‚úÖ
**File**: `backend/medusa-config.ts`

Added Stripe Payment Provider module to Medusa backend:

```typescript
{
  resolve: '@medusajs/medusa/payment',
  options: {
    providers: [
      {
        resolve: '@medusajs/medusa/payment-stripe',
        id: 'stripe',
        options: {
          apiKey: process.env.STRIPE_API_KEY,
          webhookSecret: process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET,
          capture: true,  // Auto-capture payments
          automatic_payment_methods: true,  // Better UX
        },
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Production-ready Stripe integration
- Automatic payment capture
- Webhook event handling
- Support for multiple payment methods

### 2. Product Detail Page Bug Fix ‚úÖ
**File**: `frontend/app/products/[handle]/page.tsx:33-36`

Fixed API call to request `calculated_price` field:

```typescript
const response = await medusa.store.product.list({
  handle,
  fields: '+variants,+variants.calculated_price'
})
```

**Before**: Price field not requested ‚Üí always showed $0.00
**After**: Correctly fetches price from Medusa backend

### 3. Railway Environment Variables ‚úÖ
Added to production environment:

```bash
STRIPE_API_KEY=sk_live_51RdPwMP4GPds5FMq... ‚úÖ
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_51RdPwMP4GPds5FMq... ‚úÖ
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_51RdPwMP4GPds5FMq... ‚úÖ
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=(need to add after creating webhook) ‚è≥
RESEND_API_KEY=re_HREyM8WN_HWYL3CyoTZzGyCTGzKMf6BgR ‚úÖ
ADMIN_EMAIL=shenna@shennastudio.com ‚úÖ
```

### 4. Email Integration ‚úÖ
**Files Created**:
- `frontend/src/lib/resend.ts` - Email service
- `frontend/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` - Stripe webhook handler

**Features**:
- Beautiful HTML email receipts for customers
- Sales notifications to admin
- Ocean-themed branding
- Order details, shipping info, itemized pricing

## ‚ùå Critical Issue: No Prices in Database

### The Root Cause

ALL products in your Medusa backend have **ZERO prices configured**. This is why:

- ‚ùå Products show $0.00 on frontend
- ‚ùå Checkout fails with "Invalid price" error
- ‚ùå Stripe cannot process $0.00 transactions

**Evidence from API**:
```bash
curl "https://backend-production-38d0a.up.railway.app/store/products/prod_01K73R9CBMC8NP4YY0H9A63Z8Y?fields=+variants,+variants.calculated_price"

Response: Has prices: False, Has calculated_price: False
```

### Why Checkout Fails

The checkout validation (`frontend/app/api/create-checkout-session/route.ts:48-50`) rejects $0.00 prices:

```typescript
if (!unitAmount || unitAmount <= 0) {
  throw new Error(`Invalid price for item: ${item.title} (${unitAmount})`)
}
```

This is a **safety feature** to prevent creating invalid Stripe checkout sessions.

## üîß How to Fix (REQUIRED for Checkout to Work)

### Step 1: Access Medusa Admin

1. Go to: **https://backend-production-38d0a.up.railway.app/app**
2. Log in with your admin credentials
   - Email: `shenna@shennastudio.com`
   - Password: (your admin password)

### Step 2: Add Prices to Products

**For the Turquoise Bracelet** ($34.99):

1. Click **"Products"** in left sidebar
2. Find **"Turquoise Turtle Seashell Jade Bracelet"**
3. Click on it to open product details
4. Scroll to **"Variants"** section
5. Click on the variant (should be "Original")
6. Look for **"Pricing"** or **"Manage Prices"** button
7. Click **"Add Price"**
8. **Currency**: Select **USD**
9. **Amount**: Enter **3499** (this is $34.99 in cents)
10. Click **"Save"**

**For All Other Products**:

Repeat the above steps for EVERY product you want to sell.

**Price Entry Reference**:

| Dollar Amount | Enter in Admin (cents) |
|---------------|------------------------|
| $10.00        | 1000                   |
| $15.50        | 1550                   |
| $25.99        | 2599                   |
| $34.99        | 3499                   |
| $49.50        | 4950                   |
| $100.00       | 10000                  |

**Important**:
- Stripe minimum price: $0.50 (enter `50` or higher)
- Each variant needs its own price (not just the product)
- Prices are stored in **cents** (multiply dollars by 100)

### Step 3: Test After Adding Prices

Once you've added prices to the bracelet:

1. **Refresh product page**: https://www.shennastudio.com/products/turquoise-turtle-seashell-jade-bracelet
2. **Verify price shows**: Should display **$34.99** instead of $0.00
3. **Test checkout**:
   - Add bracelet to cart
   - Click "Proceed to Checkout"
   - Should redirect to Stripe checkout page
   - Complete purchase with live card (you'll be charged!)

---

## üöÄ How Checkout Works (After Prices Are Added)

### Current Flow (Custom Stripe Checkout)

The current implementation uses a **custom Stripe Checkout Session**, which is a valid production approach:

```
Customer clicks "Proceed to Checkout"
        ‚Üì
Frontend calls /api/create-checkout-session
        ‚Üì
Creates Stripe Checkout Session with cart items
        ‚Üì
Redirects to Stripe hosted checkout page
        ‚Üì
Customer enters payment info on Stripe
        ‚Üì
Stripe processes payment
        ‚Üì
Redirects to success/cancel page
        ‚Üì
Stripe webhook sends checkout.session.completed event
        ‚Üì
Backend sends email receipts via Resend
```

**Pros of Current Approach**:
‚úÖ Simple and secure
‚úÖ Stripe handles all payment UI
‚úÖ PCI compliance built-in
‚úÖ Works immediately once prices are added
‚úÖ Production-ready for live payments

**Cons**:
‚ùå Less customization of checkout UI
‚ùå Redirects away from your site
‚ùå Not integrated with Medusa order management

### Future Enhancement (Medusa Native Payment Sessions)

I've configured the backend for Medusa's native payment flow, which offers:

‚úÖ Cart payment sessions
‚úÖ Medusa order creation
‚úÖ Better admin panel integration
‚úÖ Support for multiple payment providers
‚úÖ Custom checkout UI on your site

To implement this in the future, you would:

1. Use Medusa SDK's `initiatePaymentSession()` instead of custom API
2. Complete cart with `medusa.store.cart.complete(cartId)`
3. Render Stripe Elements on your checkout page
4. Keep users on shennastudio.com during checkout

**This is an optional enhancement** for when you want more control over the checkout UX.

## üîç Troubleshooting

### "Checkout failed with Invalid price error"
**Cause**: Product has no price in Medusa backend
**Fix**: Add prices via admin panel (see Step 2 above)

### "Products still show $0.00 after adding prices"
**Cause**: Browser cache or frontend not requesting `calculated_price`
**Fix**:
1. Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+F5)
2. Verify price exists in backend API:
   ```bash
   curl "https://backend-production-38d0a.up.railway.app/store/products/PRODUCT_ID?fields=+variants,+variants.calculated_price"
   ```

### "Webhook not receiving events"
**Cause**: Webhook secret not set or incorrect
**Fix**:
1. Create webhook in Stripe dashboard
2. Copy webhook signing secret
3. Add to Railway: `railway variables --set "STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_..."`

### "Customer/Admin not receiving emails"
**Cause**: Resend domain not verified or API key invalid
**Fix**:
1. Verify domain in Resend dashboard
2. Check Resend logs for delivery status
3. Verify `ADMIN_EMAIL` is set correctly

## üéâ Expected Behavior After Fix

Once you add prices to products, the complete flow will be:

1. **Customer browses products** ‚Üí Prices display correctly (not $0.00)
2. **Add to cart** ‚Üí Cart shows proper pricing
3. **Checkout** ‚Üí Redirects to Stripe with correct amounts
4. **Payment** ‚Üí Stripe processes live payment
5. **Success** ‚Üí Customer sees confirmation page
6. **Emails sent**:
   - Customer receives beautiful order receipt
   - Admin receives sales notification at `shenna@shennastudio.com`
7. **Webhook logged** ‚Üí Check Railway logs to verify

## üìù Next Steps

### Immediate (Required for checkout to work):
1. **Add prices to all products** via Medusa admin panel
2. **Test bracelet checkout** with $34.99 price
3. **Create Stripe live webhook** and add secret to Railway
