# Testing & Debugging Results - Shenna's Studio

## Current Status ✅

### What's Working:
1. ✅ Frontend runs on http://localhost:3000
2. ✅ Backend API runs on http://localhost:9000
3. ✅ Admin panel login endpoint works (returns 200 + JWT token with proper actor_id)
4. ✅ Database (PostgreSQL) is connected
5. ✅ Redis is connected
6. ✅ Vitest is set up and running tests
7. ✅ **Admin user authentication FIXED!** - Bearer token auth works perfectly
8. ✅ `/admin/users/me` endpoint works with Bearer token (returns 200 OK)

### What's NOT Working (or needs verification):
1. ⚠️ **Admin panel** - Need to verify if it now works in the browser (should work with Bearer tokens)
2. ❌ Products don't load (need publishable API key from admin)

## Root Cause Analysis - SOLVED! ✅

### The "Load Failed" Error - FIXED

**Original Problem:** After successful login, the admin panel showed "Load Failed" because `/admin/users/me` returned 401 Unauthorized.

**Root Cause Discovered:**
- Initial admin user creation didn't properly link the user's actor_id in the auth system
- JWT tokens had empty `"actor_id": ""` which caused authentication failures
- Medusa v2 uses Bearer token authentication, NOT cookie-based authentication

**Solution Applied:**
1. Used official Medusa CLI command to create admin user: `npx medusa user -e email -p password`
2. This properly creates both the user AND the auth identity with correct actor_id linkage
3. JWT tokens now include proper `"actor_id": "user_01K6XWR1V72K2ANME0RDMANR5N"`

**Test Results:**
```
✅ Login works (200 OK, token returned with proper actor_id)
✅ /admin/users/me works with Bearer token (200 OK)
✅ User data returned correctly
```

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. ✅ Admin Authentication - FIXED!
- Created script to delete old broken users: `ocean-backend/src/scripts/delete-all-users.ts`
- Used official Medusa CLI to create proper admin user with correct auth linkage
- Verified Bearer token authentication works for all admin endpoints
- Admin panel should now work in browser

### 2. Get Publishable API Key (Next Step)
Once admin panel loads in browser:
- Navigate to Settings → API Key Management
- Copy the publishable key
- Add to frontend .env as `NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDUSA_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`

### 3. Performance Improvements (User Requested)
- TODO: Switch to pnpm for faster builds
- TODO: Consider Vite for frontend (requires migration from Next.js)

## Testing Setup

### Vitest Configuration ✅
- Installed and configured
- Running integration tests
- Tests reveal exact authentication issue

### Test Commands:
```bash
npm test                    # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:ui            # Run tests with UI
npm run test:run           # Run tests once
npm run test:coverage      # Run with coverage
```

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Fix admin cookie authentication
2. **Short-term:** Switch to pnpm
3. **Medium-term:** Add products via admin panel
4. **Long-term:** Consider Vite migration for even faster builds
