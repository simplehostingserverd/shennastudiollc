# Blog Post Seeding Guide

This guide explains how to seed your blog with 6 SEO-optimized posts on Railway.

## Automatic Seeding (Recommended)

Blog posts are **automatically seeded on every Railway deployment** via the `railway-start.sh` script.

### How it Works

1. Railway builds your application
2. `railway-start.sh` runs before starting the server
3. Prisma migrations are applied
4. Blog posts are seeded (skips existing posts)
5. Server starts

**No manual action needed!** Just deploy and the blog posts will be there.

## Manual Seeding (If Needed)

If you need to manually seed blog posts on Railway:

### Option 1: Using Railway CLI

```bash
# Connect to your Railway project
railway link

# Run the seed script
railway run bash railway-seed.sh
```

### Option 2: Using Railway Dashboard

1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Click on your frontend service
3. Go to "Settings" > "Deploy"
4. Add a new "Start Command":
   ```bash
   bash railway-seed.sh && bash railway-start.sh
   ```
5. Redeploy

### Option 3: SSH into Railway

```bash
# Connect to running container
railway connect

# Run seed command
npx tsx scripts/seed-blog-posts.ts

# Exit
exit
```

## Verification

Check if blog posts were seeded:

### Via Railway Logs

```bash
railway logs
```

Look for:
```
ðŸŒ± Seeding blog posts...
âœ… Created: Ultimate Guide to Ocean-Inspired Jewelry...
âœ… Created: Marine Conservation...
```

### Via Your Website

Visit: `https://www.shennastudio.com/blog`

You should see 6 published blog posts.

### Via Database Query

```bash
railway connect
npx prisma studio
```

Navigate to `BlogPost` table and verify 6 posts exist.

## Troubleshooting

### Blog Posts Not Showing

**Problem**: Blog page is empty or shows "No posts found"

**Solutions**:

1. Check Railway logs for seeding errors:
   ```bash
   railway logs | grep "seed"
   ```

2. Verify DATABASE_URL is set:
   ```bash
   railway variables
   ```

3. Manually run seed script:
   ```bash
   railway run bash railway-seed.sh
   ```

4. Check Prisma client is generated:
   ```bash
   railway run npx prisma generate
   ```

### Duplicate Posts

**Problem**: Seed script creates duplicate posts

**Solution**: The script is idempotent - it checks for existing posts by `slug` and skips them. If you see duplicates, check for posts with different slugs but same titles.

To remove duplicates:
```bash
railway connect
npx prisma studio
# Delete duplicate posts manually
```

### Migration Errors

**Problem**: `Migration failed` errors in logs

**Solutions**:

1. Check if migrations need to be deployed:
   ```bash
   railway run npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```

2. Reset database (WARNING: deletes all data):
   ```bash
   railway run npx prisma migrate reset
   ```

3. Generate Prisma client:
   ```bash
   railway run npx prisma generate
   ```

### Permission Errors

**Problem**: `Permission denied` when running seed script

**Solution**:
```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x railway-seed.sh
git add railway-seed.sh
git commit -m "fix: Make railway-seed.sh executable"
git push
```
