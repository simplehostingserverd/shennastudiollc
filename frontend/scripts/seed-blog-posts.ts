# Coral Reef Protection 2025: Why Ocean Conservation Matters Now

Coral reefs cover less than 1% of the ocean floor but support 25% of all marine life. Often called the "rainforests of the sea," these vital ecosystems face unprecedented threats. The good news? Innovative conservation efforts are making real progress, and your support can help save these irreplaceable habitats.

## Understanding Coral Reefs: Nature's Underwater Cities

### What Are Coral Reefs?

Coral reefs are complex ecosystems built by tiny animals called polyps:

**Coral Polyps**:
- Tiny animals related to jellyfish and anemones
- Build hard calcium carbonate skeletons
- Live in symbiosis with algae called zooxanthellae
- Form colonies creating massive reef structures

**Reef Types**:
1. **Fringing Reefs**: Grow close to shorelines
2. **Barrier Reefs**: Separated from land by deep lagoons
3. **Atolls**: Ring-shaped reefs around lagoons
4. **Patch Reefs**: Isolated reef formations

### The Importance of Coral Reefs

Coral reefs provide immense value to our planet:

**Marine Biodiversity**:
- Home to over 4,000 fish species
- Habitat for sea turtles, sharks, and rays
- Breeding grounds for countless species
- Nurseries for juvenile fish

**Human Benefits**:
- **Food Security**: 1 billion people depend on reefs for protein
- **Coastal Protection**: Reefs reduce wave energy by 97%, protecting shorelines
- **Economic Value**: $375 billion annually in goods and services
